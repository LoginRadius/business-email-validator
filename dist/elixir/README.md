# BusinessEmailValidator

This library contains a custom and minimal wrapper for ELixir, to use the BusinessEmailValidator dataset directly.

Important to note is that the dataset is read and parsed in compilation time, improving the running time by a huge margin.

## Installation

This package is **not** available in Hex. We suggest you to copy the JSON file from the `src` folder on this project's root, and copy this model implementation.
